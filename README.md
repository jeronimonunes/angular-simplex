# SimplexWeb

This project aims to provide an easy to use simplex that works offline within a browser and can possibly show the steps taken to find the optimal value (or certificates for non optimal ones).

## Before start

Install the project dependencies by running `npm install`

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Ace Editor

This project uses the Ace Editor in its distribution "brace" <https://github.com/thlorenz/brace>. It has a syntax highlighter to highlight the Linear Program that the person is writting. The Ace mod with the highlighter is within src/app/prog-lin/ace.mod.ts.
